# Chosen Foundation

-------------------------------------------------

I love Chosen's functionality, but I'm not crazy about how it looks.

I also love using Zurb Foundation.

This fork's goal is to make Foundation and Chosen work well together,
and to emulate the design aesthetic of Foundation in Chosen.

I set up a middleman project with Foundation and Chosen to make it easy for myself
to change the design and see how it looks with Foundation.

If you just want to make chosen look like this all you need is the chosen/chosen.css file.

Here is how Chosen looks on this fork:
